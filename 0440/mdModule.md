title: "Module 0440: Syntax and the Syntax to Describe Syntax"
---

# Context

* What is this?
  * This module describes what syntax means, and the syntax used to describe syntax.
* Why is this important?
  * On the path to learning how to program, understanding and applying the syntax of a programming language is important. Instead of using a "loose" pseudocode syntax, it is more efficient to "learn the real thing" from the get-go!
* How is this done?
  * This is accomplished by using a *meta* syntax language.
 
# Meta syntax

The syntax of a programming language is like the grammatical rules of the programming language. These rules are often specified by some form of meta syntax. One commonly used meta syntax is called [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) (Backus-Naur form). 

The syntax of C++ is intermediate compared to other programming languages. A plain BNF description of C++ can be difficult to follow. However, a BNF description that makes use of hyperlinks is considerably easier to follow. Fortunately, Alessio Marchetti has already created a [hyperlinked BNF description of the syntax of C++](https://alx71hub.github.io/hcb/).

## How to read the BNF notation

### The basics

Each syntactic rule (also called a "production") consists of two parts:

* the token being defined
* what the token can be expanded to

Let us consider the following example. An [iteration-statement](https://alx71hub.github.io/hcb/#iteration-statement) is describe as follows:

|token|expansion|
|-|-|
|*iteration-statement*|**while (** *condition* **)** *statement*<br />**do** *statement* **while (** *expression* **);** <br /> **for (** *for-init-statmentcondition*<sub>opt</sub> **;** *expression*<sub>opt</sub> **)** *statement* <br />**for (** *for-range-declaration* **:** *for-range-initializer* **)** *statement*

In this syntactic rule, the token *`iteration-statement`* has four alternative expansions as each line of the "expansion" column is one alternative. In each expansion alternative, anything that is **boldface** must be entered verbatim, while anything not in boldface is a token with its own expansion. The subscript "opt" designates the token to be optional. Optional means the same as zero or one occurrence.

Essentially, a token (italicized and not boldfaced) is a placeholder. A placeholder can be holding a space (a position in a sequence) for nothing or many components. A boldfaced item is also known as a "terminal", a terminal specifies the text expected verbatim.

### Repetition

BNF can be used to express the repetition of a pattern. Let us consider the syntactic rule of a `statement-seq` (statement sequence):

|token|expansion|
|-|-|
|*statement-seq*|*statement*<br />*statement-seq statement*|

This shows that there are two alternatives to expand a `statement-seq` token:

* *`statement`*: the first alternative is a simpler token, a single statement.
* *`statement-seq statement`*: the second alternative specifies a statement sequence, followed by a single statement.

### An example

Let us consider an example that does not relate to a complex programming language. For brevity, we will use the following notation:

*`token1`* ::= *`token2`* **blah**

The above example is a rule to expand *`token1`* to *`token2`* followed by the word "blah" verbatim. You can consider the symbol ::= to mean "can expand to".

With this notation, now we define the following rules:

* R1: *`friend`* ::= **Ali**
* R2: *`friend`* ::= **John**
* R3: *`friend`* ::= **Chang**
* R4: *`friends`* ::= *`friend`*
* R5: *`friends`* ::= *`friends`* **and** *`friend`*

Note that R1, R2, and R3 are alternatives to expand *`friend`*, while R4 and R5 are alternatives to expand *`friends`*. A more concise way to represent the same set of rules is as follows:

* *`friend`* ::= **Ali** \| **John** \| **Chang**
* *`friends`* ::= *`friend`* \| *`friends`* **and** *`friend`*

In the concise representation, the vertical bar symbol `|` is used to separate the alternatives to expand the token on the left-hand side of the "::=" symbol. 

Let us consider how the sentence "John and Ali and Chang" is considered syntactically correct as the token *`friends`*.

1. After processing the word "John", R2 fires and recognizes that this is a token *`friend`*.
2. R4 can also now fire and recognize that we also have a *`friends`* token.
3. The next word is "and", R5 is a *candidate* to fire, but we need another *`friend`* token.
4. The next word is "Ali", R1 fires, recognizing it matches the *`friend`* token.
5. R5 now completes its firing because there is a *`friends`* token recognized in step 2, a verbatim "and", and a *`friend`* token recognized in step 4. As R5 fires, now we have a *new* *`friends`* token recognized for the partial text of "John and Ali".
6. The next word is "and", R5 is a candidate to fire, we we need another *`friend`* token.
7. The next word is "Chang", R3 fires, we just recognized another *`friend`* token.
8. R5 now completes its firing because there is a *`friends`* token (corresponding to "John and Ali"), a verbatim word "and", and also a *`friend`* token corresponding to "Chang". We now have another *`friends`* token recognized to represent the entire text of "John and Ali and Chang".

Graphically, we can represent it as follows:

```mermaid

john[John]
and1[and]
ali[Ali]
and2[and]
chang[Chang]
friend1(friend)
friends1(friends)
friend2(friend)
friends2(friends)
friend3(friend)
friends3((friends))
john-->and1
and1-->ali
ali-->and2
and2-->chang
john-.-> friend1
friend1-.-> friends1
ali-.->friend2
friends1-.->friends2
and1-.->friends2
friend2-.->friends2
chang-.->friend3
friends2-.->friends3
and2-.->friends3
friend3-.->friends3
```

In this diagram, solid arrows indicate the flow in the text to be processed, "John and Ali and Chang". Dotted arrows indicate the recognition of a token (think of these arrows as "reversed expansion").

# Exercises

The following is generated by ChatGPT.

<details>
<summary>1. What is a syntactic rule in BNF?</summary>
A syntactic rule in BNF defines how a particular token (non-terminal) can be expanded into other tokens or terminals. It consists of a token being defined and its possible expansions, separated by "::=" or "|".
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. How is repetition expressed in BNF?</summary>
Repetition in BNF is expressed by recursive definitions. For example, in the rule:
<pre>
*statement-seq* ::= *statement* | *statement-seq statement*
</pre>
The second alternative allows *statement-seq* to repeat by including itself in the expansion.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What does "opt" mean in a BNF description?</summary>
"Opt" signifies that the token it is attached to is optional, meaning it may appear zero or one time in the syntactic structure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. In the provided "friends" example, how is the sentence "Ali and Chang" parsed?</summary>
1. "Ali" matches *`friend`* using R1.
2. R4 recognizes *`friends`*.
3. "and" triggers R5, requiring another *`friend`* token.
4. "Chang" matches *`friend`* using R3.
5. R5 completes, forming a *`friends`* token for "Ali and Chang."
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What is the difference between a terminal and a non-terminal in BNF?</summary>
A **terminal** is a literal string that appears in the final output (e.g., **"while"**, **"and"**). A **non-terminal** (or token) is a placeholder that can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Using the BNF rule <code>*digit* ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | ... | "9"</code>, how can you express a non-negative integer?</summary>
A non-negative integer can be expressed as:
<pre>
*integer* ::= *digit* | *integer digit*
</pre>
This allows one or more digits to form a number like "123".
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. How is ambiguity avoided in BNF?</summary>
Ambiguity is avoided by clearly specifying alternative expansions for tokens and ensuring that rules do not lead to multiple valid parses for the same input.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. What is the purpose of using hyperlinked BNF descriptions?</summary>
Hyperlinked BNF descriptions make it easier to navigate and understand complex syntax rules by allowing users to click on tokens and immediately view their definitions or expansions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Why is BNF considered a "meta-syntax" language?</summary>
BNF is called a meta-syntax language because it describes the syntax of programming languages, which themselves define how code should be written. It operates at a level above the syntax of the programming language being specified.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. In mathematical terms, how would you describe the recursive rule for <code>*friends*</code>?</summary>
The recursive rule can be described as:
<pre>
friends = friend
friends = friends + " and " + friend
</pre>
This is similar to defining a sequence recursively, where the base case is a single friend, and the recursive case adds "and friend" to the existing sequence.
