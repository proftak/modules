# What is this?

This is a Summer 2025 update of Tak's thoughts regarding AI within the context of teaching in general at a community college, as well as the specific subject of computer information science.

# AI in CIS

The following are some recent developments relevant to teaching computer information science in a community college.

## AI Researcher Payscale

Meta has recently started a high-profile hiring (mostly poaching) campaign, offering up to $100,000,000 (not clear about the method of distribution) to AI researchers already working for competing companies. 

**Thoughts**:

The ripple effect of Meta's action is a general salary increase for AI researchers or engineers working on AI-related products. Except for a few colleges and universities that offer AI as a degree or discipline, most incoming students need first to obtain a general computer science degree to launch their AI careers. As a result, computer science enrollment may continue to spike, although the same technology is also reducing the employment of software engineers (more on this later).

From a psychological and organizational perspective, Meta's action may be detrimental in the long run. What kind of people give up on their current jobs because of Meta's offer? What is the technical skill level of these people being poached by Meta? In short, Meta is attracting highly technically competent individuals who are drawn by substantial financial rewards. These people are also likely to be highly competitive and result-driven. It will be interesting to see how these people work out when they share the same employer.
