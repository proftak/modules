<p>The instructor is available to discuss accommodation issues. Please

<h1 data-number="9" id="conduct"><span
class="header-section-number">9</span> Conduct</h1>
<p><a
href="https://arc.losrios.edu/student-resources/office-of-student-conduct/expectations-of-behavior-and-conduct">Refer
to the college’s expectations of behavior and conduct</a> for more
details. Specifically, refer to the <a
href="https://arc.losrios.edu/student-standards-of-conduct-guide/student-standards-of-conduct-guide/student-standards-of-conduct-guide">guide</a>.</p>
<p>The instructor’s policy is to be consistent with the expectations
from the <a
href="https://arc.losrios.edu/student-resources/office-of-student-conduct">Office
of Student Conduct</a>. The instructor <strong>will report all cases of
violations</strong>. The <em>minimum</em> consequence of a violation is
a score of zero assigned to the assessment that is in violation (in the
case of academic dishonesty). In the case of violations that are not of
the nature of academic dishonesty (such as bullying), The instructor can
choose to remove the involved people from one or more class meeting(s).
The Office of Student Conduct may incur additional consequences.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.1" id="academic-honestyintegrity"><span
class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Academic honesty/integrity</h2>
<p>The basis of academic integrity policies is that the grade of an
individual X should reflect the academic performance of X, and X alone.
Furthermore, the performance assessment should also be conducted in a
way that is consistent with the peers of X. Academic integrity also
includes rule-compliance and truthfulness in all class-related
activities, such as roll taking.</p>
<p>For example, signing a roll sheet for someone is a violation of
academic integrity. Affirming presence when a student is absent in an
in-person class is also considered a violation of the academic integrity
policy.</p>
<p>Most assessments include rules that are applied consistently to all
participants. For example, an assessment (such as an exam) may allow the
use of any handwritten or printed content on paper, but not electronic
devices. Another assessment consistency is the start and end time of an
assessment. Other rule examples include the start time, end time, and
answer collection method of an assessment.</p>
<p>As such, a <em>violation</em> of the policy happens when the
grade/score of an individual X does not reflect the academic performance
of X, and X alone. Or, the participation of the assessment is
inconsistent with the peers of X.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.2" id="non-integrity-conduct-expectations"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Non-integrity conduct
expectations</h2>
<p>Please refer to the college student conduct web page for a long
list.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that a class, virtual or in-person, should be an
environment that is free of elements that impede teaching and learning.
In this context, the “elements” refer to human behaviors. This is a list
of such behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatting.</li>
<li>Devices.</li>
<li>Other disruptions.</li>
<li>Bullying.</li>
<li>Threatening.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="9.2.1" id="chatting"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2.1</span> Chatting</h3>
<p>In most cases, chatting is disruptive to students who are around the
chatters. No matter how quiet the chatters intend, chatting is still
audible to those around the chatters.</p>
<p>Conversations that do not relate to class should not be in a
classroom, period.</p>
<p>Conversations that relate to class can be handled differently. For
example, raising a hand and ask the professor instead of a neighboring
peer may better serve the class as a whole.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.2" id="devices"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2.2</span> Devices</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we forget to disable the notifications on a phone, and a
notation can disrupt the concentration of people who are around us.</p>
<p>Most devices have a “do not disturb” feature, please make use of this
feature! On a laptop computer, the speaker can usually be muted
completely using a hot-key.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.3" id="other-disruptions"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2.3</span> Other disruptions</h3>
<p>It is impossible to enumerate every single possible source of
disruption. Please report to me if you experience disruption in class in
case I do not realize it during class.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.4" id="bullying"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2.4</span> Bullying</h3>
<p>This college has zero tolerance of bullying. Note that bullying is
the act of harming, intimidating, and/or coercing another person.
Bullying can occur physically, but it can also occur in other forms.</p>
<p>If you experience or witness bullying, please try to collect as much
evidence as possible, and report to the instructor or other college
personnel as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Note the bullying can occur on-campus physically, but it can also
occur via electronic means of communication. Cyber-bullying is not new,
and it can harm individuals just as much.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.5" id="threatening"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2.5</span> Threatening</h3>
<p>Although a component of bullying is threatening, this section
addresses the threatening of a person who is not the second party. In
other words, this section addresses the case of threatening when the
“target” is a third person.</p>
<p>For example, a person within a Discord private server may mention
something like “Sal is such a teacher’s pet, I’d like to smack him in
his face with he own laptop computer!” In this example, Sal may not even
be on the private Discord server.</p>
<p>This is still a declared threat intention. Obviously, in many cases,
the intended threat is not actually carried out. However, there is no
way for others who read the message to differentiate whether this is
just venting or a serious declaration.</p>
<p>Threats like these should also be reported for several reasons.
First, these declarations can make others (not the “target”) feel
uncomfortable, even if the declared threat is not carried out. Second,
in the event that the threat is actually serious, intervention can
prevent the actual harm.</p>
<h1 data-number="10" id="attendanceabsences"><span
class="header-section-number">10</span> Attendance/absences</h1>
<p>Refer to “Attendance” on the college’s web page on <a
href="https://arc.losrios.edu/2021-2022-official-catalog/while-you-are-here/college-and-academic-regulations">College
and Academic Regulations</a>. Specifically, read <a
href="https://arc.losrios.edu/shared/doc/board/regulations/R-2222.pdf">the
district’s attendance requirements</a> for a district-wide
regulation.</p>
<p>Note that the district or college has no policy regarding what
absences are “excused.” This prompts <a
href="https://www.arcurrent.com/opinion/2013/12/02/arc-drop-policy-shows-no-mercy-for-students/">certain
opinions</a> from certain students.</p>
<p>Attendance can be tracked by a variety of methods. The idea is that
every student should be present and on-time. In a synchronous or
in-person class, This means being late <em>can be counted as
absent</em>. Not paying attention to attendance instruction <em>can be
counted as absent</em>. Each student is responsible to arrange time and
other resources to attend lectures and labs on-time, without
interruptions/distractions, and pay attention for the entire scheduled
duration.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.1" id="why"><span
class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Why?</h2>
<p>Attendance is positively correlated with performance and success in a
class. While attendance by itself does not guarantee academic success,
it is a <em>necessary</em> component.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.2"
id="specific-to-in-person-or-synchronous-online-classes"><span
class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Specific to in-person or
synchronous online classes</h2>
<p>Attendance is taken using specific means as mentioned by the
instructor. Note that in a synchronous online class, just having a
“presence” in a communication platform such as Zoom or Discord is
insufficient to count as being present. The instructor can specify how
attendance is taken <em>during</em> a lecture.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.3" id="excessive-absences"><span
class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Excessive absences</h2>
<p>As per the district’s regulation, the threshold to be counted as
excessive is 6%. In a 16-week (full semester) class, each week is more
than 6%. This means that a <em>total</em> of absences that is equivalent
to one week’s of lectures and/or lab activities is excessive.</p>
<p>If a 16-week class meets twice per week, this means that two absences
adds up to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{16 \times
2}=\frac{1}{16}=6\frac{1}{4} \%&gt;6 \%\)</span>. Note that this method
of computing absence ratio is generous because it does not take college
observed holidays and other non-instruction days into consideration.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.4" id="what-about-excused-absences"><span
class="header-section-number">10.4</span> What about excused
absences?</h2>
<p>Neither the college (ARC) nor district (LRCCD) specifies what reasons
of absence can be excused. California Education Code <a
href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ai/tr/">does have a section</a>
regarding truancy and absences. This part of California Education Code
<a
href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=EDC&amp;sectionNum=48260.">falls
under Title 2</a> which applies to “elementary and secondary education.”
College is considered “higher education” and falls under Title 5.</p>
<p><em>As such</em>, the excuses mentioned in Title 2 (Section 48205)
<strong>do not apply</strong> to colleges.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.5"
id="so-what-is-taks-policy-regarding-absences"><span
class="header-section-number">10.5</span> So what is Tak’s policy
regarding absences?</h2>
<h3 data-number="10.5.1" id="absence-allowance"><span
class="header-section-number">10.5.1</span> Absence allowance</h3>
<p>Each student can be absent according to roll taking mechanisms up to
five (5) times before qualifying as excessively absent and dropped from
class. This policy excludes the first three (3) class meetings. <em>Any
absences</em> in the first three meetings of a class qualifies to be
dropped (this is a part of district wide regulation).</p>
<p>Essentially, the absence allowance permits up to 5 absences
throughout the entire semester. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{2\times 16}=15.625\%\)</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.5.2" id="consideration-of-excuses"><span
class="header-section-number">10.5.2</span> Consideration of
excuses</h3>
<p>An absence <em>may be excused at the discretion of the
instruction</em>. In terms of lecture and lab presence, most cases are
not excused and handled by the aforementioned absence allowance.</p>
<p>The only case where excuse is significant applies to exams. The
instructor expects each student to plan ahead and make sure that he/she
does not miss an exam, or arrive late. This may include, but is not
limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting an alarm to wake up on time,</li>
<li>Planning for alternative transportation,</li>
<li>Accounting for worst case transit time, bus schedule disruption,
etc.</li>
<li>In the case of fasting, conserve energy, drink plenty of water.
Fasting is not an acceptable excuse for being absent.</li>
<li>Religious (regardless of religion) holidays and/or related
activities.</li>
<li>Family trips and/or related activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sickness can potentially be excused if <em>all</em> the following
criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform the instructor prior to the exam start-time in a reasonable
time-frame.</li>
<li>Send the instructor a doctor’s note, prior to the exam. The doctor’s
note must meet all the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>On paper. The instructor will request to see the doctor’s note on
paper.</li>
<li>With the letter head of a licensed medical facility, including
contact information of the doctor (verifiable phone number, full name,
email, etc.) in case the instructor chooses to contact the doctor for
verification.</li>
<li>Dated, <em>not</em> back-dated.</li>
<li>A range of days to be excused, where the range <em>starts</em> with
the day on which the doctor writes the note. This means the note cannot
back-date days excused.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, the instructor may exempt time
sensitive criteria if the onset of the sickness is of an acute nature,
such as acute appendicitis. The doctor must note that the medical
condition has an acute nature as well as when the medical condition is
diagnosed.</p>
<p>In the event that the instructor excuses a student from taking an
exam on the scheduled day, the instructor may elect to administer an
exam that is different from the one administered on the scheduled
day.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.1" id="what-is-being-assessed"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1</span> What is being assessed</h2>
<p>An assessment can be a lab activity, a homework assignment, a Canvas
activity, a quiz, or an exam. For each individual part (defined by the
assessment). There are some dimensions of assessment:</p>
<h3 data-number="11.1.1" id="prior-knowledge-and-recall"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1.1</span> Prior knowledge and
recall</h3>
<p>This dimension is moot in an assessment that is open book and open
notes.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.1.2" id="analysiscritical-thinking"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1.2</span> Analysis/critical
thinking</h3>
<p>This dimension quantifies the ability to understand and break down a
question/problem into components that correlate with the
<em>correct</em> symbols, definitions, techniques, procedures, and
concepts introduced in class.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.1.3" id="synthesisproblem-solving"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1.3</span>
Synthesis/Problem-solving</h3>
<p>This dimension quantifies the ability to utilize symbols,
definitions, concepts introduced in class to achieve an objectively
defined goal.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.1.4" id="performance"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1.4</span> Performance</h3>
<p>This dimension quantifies the familiarity and efficiency of
performing critical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.2" id="meanings-of-0-to-4"><span
class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Meanings of 0 to 4</h2>
<p>Each assessment is reflected by a value ranging from 0/4 to 4/4. The
following lists how 0/4 to 4/4 are determined in the context of the
subject matter being assessed.</p>
<ul>
<li>0/4, 0% (letter grade of F):
<ul>
<li>no work is submitted, or</li>
<li>the submitted work shows, no evidence of
<ul>
<li>the ability to analyze and think critically</li>
<li>the ability to synthesize or problem-solve</li>
</ul></li>
<li>unless otherwise specified:
<ul>
<li>code that does not compile or assemble</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>1/4, 25% (letter grade of D):
<ul>
<li>the submitted work shows some, but insufficient, evidence of
<ul>
<li>the ability to analyze and think critically</li>
<li>the ability to synthesize or problem-solve</li>
<li>familiarity and efficiency do not matter when there is insufficient
evidence of the abilities to analyze and/or synthesize</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>2/4, 50% (letter grade of C):
<ul>
<li>the submitted work shows sufficient evidence of
<ul>
<li>the ability to analyze and think critically</li>
<li>the ability to synthesize or problem-solve</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the submitted work also shows evidence of
<ul>
<li>one or more conceptual mistakes</li>
<li>insufficient familiarity and/or efficiency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>3/4, 75% (letter grade of B):
<ul>
<li>the submitted work provides sufficient evidence of
<ul>
<li>the ability to analyze and think critically</li>
<li>the ability to synthesize or problem-solve</li>
<li>complete and correct understanding of material</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the submitted work also shows evidence of
<ul>
<li>one or more operational (as opposed to conceptual) mistakes and/or
omissions</li>
<li>room for improvement in terms of familiarity and/or efficiency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>4/4, 100% (letter grade of A):
<ul>
<li>the submitted work provides sufficient evidence of
<ul>
<li>the ability to analyze and think critically</li>
<li>the ability to synthesize or problem-solve</li>
<li>complete and correct understanding of material</li>
<li>operational correctness</li>
<li>excellent familiarity and/or efficiency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to convert an aggregated score <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (0/4 to 4/4) into a letter grade, the
threshold is the midpoint between two letter grades. The following are
the thresholds of a specific grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>F: <span class="math inline">\(x &lt;
\frac{1}{8}=12.5\%\)</span></li>
<li>D: <span class="math inline">\(12.5\% \le x &lt;
\frac{3}{8}=37.5\%\)</span></li>
<li>C: <span class="math inline">\(37.5\% \le x &lt;
\frac{5}{8}=62.5\%\)</span></li>
<li>B: <span class="math inline">\(62.5\% \le x &lt;
\frac{7}{8}=87.5\%\)</span></li>
<li>A: <span class="math inline">\(87.5\% \le x\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="11.3" id="late-and-makeup-policy"><span
class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Late and makeup policy</h2>
<p>In order for a submission to count to the final grade, it should be
submitted on time. In <em>certain cases</em>, the instructor may agree
to late submissions. The verifiable reasons of a late submission should
be provided to the instructor prior to the due date, and preferably at
the time the assessment is scheduled. <em>The instructor reserves the
right not to allow/grade a late submission.</em></p>
<p>Specific to exams, a makeup is possible <em>only if</em> all the
following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The instructor agrees to the makeup and the reason of the
makeup.</li>
<li>The reason(s) of the makeup is/are satisfactorily verifiable.</li>
<li>The request of a makeup is prior to the scheduled date/time of the
exam.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, <em>the instructor reserves the right not to allow a makeup of
am exam.</em></p>
