{% assign courseTitle="	CISP 310: Computer Architecture and Organization" %}
{% assign courseDescription="This course covers the organization and behavior of real computer systems at the assembly-language level. Topics include the mapping of statements and constructs in a high-level language onto sequences of machine instructions, as well as the internal representation of simple data types and structures. Numerical computation is examined, noting the various data representation errors and potential procedural errors."  %}
{%- capture slos -%}
write simple assembly language program segments.
demonstrate how fundamental high-level programming constructs are implemented at the machine-language level.
compare Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) versus Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) architectures.
diagnose assembly language programs with common and not-so-common defects.
structure complex logic into well-defined assembly language instruction sequences and subroutines.
evaluate common coding mistakes in C/C++ in the context of the underlying assembly language implementation.
describe von Neumann architecture and how its components interact.
