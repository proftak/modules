analyze how formal tools of symbolic logic are used to model real-life situations, including those arising in computing contexts such as program correctness, database queries, and algorithms.
compare mathematical induction as a proof technique to recursion and recursively defined structures as programming concepts.
analyze a problem to create relevant recurrence equations.
design different traversal methods for trees and graphs.
choose between the binomial theorem for independent events and Bayes’ theorem for dependent events.
