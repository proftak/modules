title: "Module 0443: A more hair-splitting way to define set notations"
---

# Prerequisites

* [Module 0279: boolean operators](https://proftak.github.io/modules/0279/mdModule.html)
* [Module 0440: the syntax to describe syntax](https://proftak.github.io/0440/mdModule.html)
* A general understanding of and the ability to differentiate the following words/phrases: "all," "every," and "at least one."

# Operators and notations

* $\boxed{a \in X}$ means $a$, as a value, is an element of set $X$. This is a boolean operator that can be evaluated to be true or false.
  * Concept: "element of" as an operator that returns a boolean value.
  * Concept level: foundational, all other set notations depend on this concept.
  * Symbol: $\in$.
* $a = b$ means that the value of $a$ and the value of $b$ are the same, hence interchangeable.
  * Concept: "equal to" as an operator that returns a boolean value when two values or expressions can be used interchangeably.
  * Concept level: foundational, many other set notations such as intersection, union, etc. depend on this concept.
  * Symbol: $=$.
* As a predicate, $P(a)$ is a function that returns a boolean (true/false) value, $a$ is the parameter, and $P$ is the name of the predicate. This is a useful notation that takes the place of a potentially complicated expression. The actual definition of $P(a)$ depends on the context.
  * Concept: a predicate is a function that returns a boolean value.
  * Concept level: abstraction notation, a predicate is a placeholder of some operation on some value that returns a boolean value. Predicates are useful in the discussion of quantifiers.
* $\boxed{\forall e}(P(e))$ means "for every value $e$, $P(e)$ is true." This universally-quantified expression returns a boolean value.
  * Concept: universal quantifier to quantify a statement being universally true.
  * Concept level: an abstract concept that is needed to define set notations.
  * Symbol: $\forall$
* $\boxed{\exists e}(P(e))$ means "there is at least one value $e$ such that $P(e)$ is true." This existentially-quantified expression returns a boolean value.
  * Concept: existential quantifier to quantify a statement being true for at least one "instance."
  * Concept level: an abstract concept that is needed to define set notations.
  * Symbol: $\exists$
* $\forall e((e \in (\boxed{X \cap Y)}) \Leftrightarrow ((e \in X) \wedge (e \in Y)))$ is *definitive*, $X \cap Y$ is the *intersection* of the sets $X$ and $Y$. The term "definitive" means an expression true by definition.
  * Concept: intersection.
  * Concept level: a basic set operator that returns a set. Dependent on boolean operators, element of, and quantifiers.
  * Symbol: $\cap$
* $\forall e((e \in (\boxed{X \cup Y)}) \Leftrightarrow ((e \in X) \vee (e \in Y)))$ is *definitive*. $X \cup Y$ is the *union* of the sets $X$ and $Y$.
  * Concept: union.
  * Concept level: a basic set operator that returns a set. Dependent on boolean operators, element of, and quantifiers.
  * Symbol: $\cup$
* $\forall e((e \in (\boxed{X - Y})) \Leftrightarrow ((e \in X) \wedge \neg(e \in Y)))$ is *definitive*. $X - Y$ is the *difference* of the sets $X$ and $Y$.
  * Concept: difference.
  * Concept level: a basic set operator that returns a set. Dependent on boolean operators, element of, and quantifiers.
  * Symbol: $-$
* $\boxed{X \subseteq Y} \Leftrightarrow \forall e(((e \in X) \Rightarrow (e \in Y)))$ is *definitive*. $X \subseteq Y$ evaluates whether $X$ is a subset of $Y$, it says "every element $e$ in set $X$ is also in set $Y$."
  * Concept: subset of.
  * Concept level: a basic set operator that returns a boolean value. Dependent on boolean operators, element of, and quantifiers.
  * Symbol: $\subseteq$
* $\boxed{X \subset Y} \Leftrightarrow ((X \subseteq Y) \wedge (\exists e((e \in Y) \wedge \neg(e \in X))))$ is definitive. $X \subset Y$ evaluates whether $X$ is a *proper* subset of $Y$. There needs to be one element in $Y$ but not in $X$.
  * Concept: (from here on, fill in these in your notes)
  * Concept level:
  * Symbol:
* $\forall e((e \in \boxed{\\{e\|P(e)\\}}) \Leftrightarrow (P(e)))$ is *definitive*. This is a notation to describe the membership of a set with an infinite number of elements, where $P$ is a predicate.
* To describe all the members of a set that has a finite number of elements:
  * The general BNF syntax is as follows: **\{** [ *`element`* \{ **,** *`element`* \}*] **\}**
    * Anything that is **bold** is a terminal; it should be a part of the expression verbatim.
    * Anything that is *`italic`* is a token; it is a placeholder of something else.
    * Anything that is between brackets [] is optional; there may be zero or one occurrence.
    * Anything that is between braces \{\} is a group.
    * Anything that is followed immediately by an asterisk * can occur any number of times, including zero.
  * Given the syntax described, the ordering of elements in this notation is not important. As an example, $\\{a,b,c\\} = \\{a,c,b\\} = \\{b,a,c\\} = \\{b,c,a\\} = \\{c,a,b\\} = \\{c,b,a\\}$.
  * $\boxed{\\{\\}}$ is known as the empty set.
* $\boxed{\|X\|}$ is the cardinality of the set $X$, the cardinality of a set is *similar* to the number of elements in the set.
* $\boxed{\forall e \in X(P(e))}$ is an abbreviation of $\forall e((e \in X) \Rightarrow (P(e)))$, it says "for every element $e$ in set $X$, $P(e)$ is true."
* $\boxed{\exists e \in X(P(e))}$ is an abbreviation of $\exists e((e \in X) \wedge (P(e)))$, it says "there is at least one element $e$ in set $X$ such that $P(e)$ is true."
* The general BNF of a tuple is as follows: **(** [ *`element`* \{ **,** *`element`* \}*] **)**. The ordering of values in a tuple is significant.
* $\forall e(\forall f(((e,f) \in \boxed{X \times Y}) \Leftrightarrow ((e \in X) \wedge (f \in Y))))$ is definitive. $X \times Y$ is called the cartesian product of the sets $X$ and $Y$, each element in $X \times Y$ is a two-tuple (tuple with two items), where the first item in the 2-tuple is an element from $X$ and the second item is an element from $Y$.
* Given $X$ and $Y$ are sets, then $(\boxed{X=Y}) \Leftrightarrow ((X \subseteq Y) \wedge (Y \subseteq X))$, this defines the equality of two sets, and it lays the foundation of understanding nested sets. This definition is also equivalent to $(X=Y) \Leftrightarrow (\forall e((e \in X) \Leftrightarrow (e \in Y)))$.
  * Examples to be discussed in class.
