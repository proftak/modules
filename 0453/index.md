# The basic question

The fundamental question is how AI can help students achieve long-term career and potentially lifelong objectives. To consider this question, we can think of AI as a smart and knowledgeable person who may or may not act in the best interest of a student. Furthermore, this "person" can be reached 24/7 with a minimal fee of $20/month.

What exactly is "in the best interest of students?"
