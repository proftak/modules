title: "Module 0462: CS reality in 2026"
---
# Context

The context of this module is for students persuing a computer science degree, possibly in freshman or sophomore year. 

# Variables

There are many variables or parameters that impact the CS reality.

## COVID/pandemic impact

For *most* freshman and sophomore students, the COVID pandemic impact is significant. In order for the youngest student to be a freshman or sophomore in 2026, the student would have been in eighth or nineth grade or so. This is significant because eighth and ninth grade introduce important concepts in math that are founcational to computer science. 

The impact of COVID/pandemic is not limited to the depth of knowledge due to the modality of delivery. The change to pass/no pass scale and the consequent "pass-along" effect changed the math readiness of high school graduates.

Furthermore, there is also the attention span muscle apathy issue. During the pandemic, many high school classes were online and asynchronous. As a result, students did not get the opportunity to develop their attention span (brain) muscles.
