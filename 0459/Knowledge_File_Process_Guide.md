# Knowledge File Creation Process

This document describes the **generalized steps** to convert an instructional module into a **knowledge file** optimized for use in a custom GPT. The same steps can be applied to other content files.

---

## 1. Extract the Source Content
- Begin with the raw instructional module in Markdown (or plain text).
- Identify the main **sections** and **subsections**.

---

## 2. Atomize the Content
- Break down large sections into **atomic chunks**, where each chunk covers **one core concept** only.

---

## 3. Add Metadata for Retrieval
For each chunk, prepend metadata that helps GPT retrieval:

- **Intent**: One or two sentences summarizing the purpose of the chunk.
- **Q/A Examples**: 1–2 representative question/answer pairs phrased in natural language.
- **Synonyms**: Alternate terms and phrasings students might use in queries.
- **Retrieval Hooks**: Keywords, short phrases, or code tokens strongly tied to the concept.

This metadata improves retrieval accuracy and disambiguation.

---

## 4. Preserve the Instructional Content
- Under a “**Content**” section, paste the original instructional explanation, examples, and code snippets.
- Ensure the chunk still reads correctly in isolation.

---

## 5. Formatting the Knowledge File
Each chunk should be structured as:

```markdown
## [Chunk Title]

**Intent:** [One-sentence purpose]

**Q/A Examples:**
- **Q:** [Likely query]  
  **A:** [Concise answer]

**Synonyms:** [comma-separated terms]

**Retrieval Hooks:** [comma-separated keywords]

**Content:** [Original instructional explanation with examples]
```

---

## 6. Export as Markdown
- Save the file as `xxxx_KnowledgeFile.md` where `xxxx` is the name of the original file or the title of the original content.
- Upload to the custom GPT knowledge base.

---

## Summary of Benefits
- **Atomic chunks** → improve precision and reduce irrelevant retrieval.  
- **Metadata (Intent, Q/A, Synonyms, Hooks)** → provide clear signals for the retriever.  
- **Preserved instructional content** → ensures GPT responses remain accurate and pedagogically useful.
