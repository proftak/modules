# What is a Custom GPT?

A custom GPT is a structures interaction with ChatGPT. There are two main components to a custom GPT:

* An instruction. This is the text that is preloaded into every prompt in a custom GPT chat. The purpose of the instruction is to remind ChatGPT of everything that it should know in the interaction.
* Support files. These files from the knowledge "chunk" from which a custom GPT response may refer to. These files can be large and exceed the context window size of a model.

Together, a custom GPT can serve a specific role, with specific constraints and mode of operation, and specific knowledge to reference.

In the context of OER, a custom GPT can serve as an interactive book, a tutor, or a virtual professor. The key is the collection of support files.
